Dockerfile for ROS Kinetic `desktop-full`, built on top of the ros:kinetic official image

Features:
* X11 authentication for GUIs
* Image size: 3.47GB
* User created during runtime

## Build the image
```
docker build -t diegoferigo/ros-desktop-full .
```

## User configuration
Several reasons could be found for having a non-root user within the container
that matches the GID and UID of your host user.

This docker image allows the creation of a runtime user, whose default UID and
GID is 1000. To override these values and to start the container, execute:
```
USER_UID=1000
USER_GID=1000
USERNAME=foo

docker run -i -t --rm \
	-e USER_UID=$USER_UID \
	-e USER_GID=$USER_GID \
	-e USERNAME=$USERNAME \
	--name ros \
	diegoferigo/ros-desktop-full \
	bash
```
Then, create as many ttys as needed with
```
docker exec -it ros bash
```
The image does not contain `sudo` and the root password is not set. When the active
user is not root, to execute commands that require admin privileges you should
open a new tty or use `exit` on the current shell getting back to the root user.

## X11 authentication

As an example, `rqt` is forwarded from within the container to the host Xserver:
```
XSOCK=/tmp/.X11-unix
XAUTH=/tmp/.docker.xauth

touch $XAUTH
xauth nlist $DISPLAY | sed -e 's/^..../ffff/' | xauth -f $XAUTH nmerge -

docker run -i -t --rm \
	-v $XSOCK:$XSOCK:rw \
	-v $XAUTH:$XAUTH:rw \
	-e XAUTHORITY=${XAUTH} \
	-e DISPLAY \
	--name ros \
	diegoferigo/ros-desktop-full \
	rqt
```
If you need HW acceleration (only for Intel graphic cards), add also this device
flag `--device=/dev/dri`.
